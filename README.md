## 📝 NOTE

The default username for **AspGoat** is **admin** and the default password is **admin123**. The 🐞 **Unrestricted File Upload** Lab can break the application. A ***Hard Reset*** feature is currently under development which will reset the application (not yet released). As of now, if you break the application during explotation of the Lab, your only option is cloning the Project again and restart the application. The Client Side **JavaScript** is obfuscated due to obvious cheating possibilities for **Secure Coding** challenges. However, there are several tools available for de-obfuscating the **JavaScript** code and retrieve the clean code again but that is not the core purpose of this Project.
